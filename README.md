## Introduction

Greenhouse gases are significant contributors to climate change. Understanding their emission patterns is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This analysis examines global GHG emissions over time, identifies major emitting countries, and explores sector-specific contributions.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes the following datasets:

- **World Bank Data**: Provides comprehensive data on CO₂ emissions by country and year.
- **Our World in Data**: Offers datasets on CH₄ and N₂O emissions, including sector-specific information.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency across datasets.
- **Data Merging**: Combining datasets based on common attributes such as country and year.
- **Normalization**: Adjusting emission values to per capita metrics for comparative analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory analysis covers:

- **Temporal Trends**: Examining emission patterns over time for each GHG.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Identifying countries with the highest emission levels.
- **Sectoral Contributions**: Analyzing emissions by sectors such as energy, agriculture, and industry.

## Key Findings

- **CO₂ Emissions**:
  - Global CO₂ emissions have increased over the past decades, with significant contributions from industrialized nations.
  - The energy sector remains the largest source of CO₂ emissions.

- **CH₄ Emissions**:
  - Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, is the primary source of methane emissions.
  - Certain developing countries exhibit high per capita CH₄ emissions due to agricultural practices.

- **N₂O Emissions**:
  - Fertilizer use in agriculture is a major contributor to nitrous oxide emissions.
  - There is a notable increase in N₂O emissions in regions with intensive farming activities.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the critical need for targeted policies to reduce GHG emissions. Mitigation efforts should focus on:

- Transitioning to renewable energy sources to curb CO₂ emissions.
- Implementing sustainable agricultural practices to reduce CH₄ and N₂O emissions.
- Enhancing international cooperation to address emissions from high-contributing countries and sectors.
